Payroll Calculator

Task:
Create a form
Display total amount of deductions
Display gross pay
Display total/net pay
Apply a theme of your choice

Using following logic:
Hourly rate- 
•	10-25$ --------- Tax 5% deductions
•	26-50$ --------Tax 7 % deductions
Number of hours
•	<=40 -> No change in pay
•	>40 -> every additional hour more than 40 hours you get 5% increase in their hourly rate
•	Number of hours is >=20 and <=60 hours

Added by me:
Show deduction rate
Show overtime hours
Show overtime rate
Show extra overtime pay
